One of the main reasons why I started this project is because of the idea I had for this workshop that I have come to call lexter. Lexter is a workshop that analyses the content of a static site, and builds reports on the sites content.

## Word Count reports

One of the basic features of lexter is the word count report. This is just simply a list of links to each file that lexter checked out, and the count of words found on the page. This report alone is helpful for making a crude judgment on post quality, as it appears that google does seem to prefer lengthy posts on subjects.
