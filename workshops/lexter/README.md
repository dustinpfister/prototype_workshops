# Lexter

Lexter is a lexical (text) analyses workshop that builds a collection of html files that are reports on the content of the site that it is a part of. Lexter helps to give insight on the nature of a sites text content by letting you know which posts are the longest, and which posts respond best with given keywords.

Lexter can be used in conjunction with what may be appearing in the sites search console to help gain a better sense of what is working, and what is not. It can also be used as a crude way of determining blog post quality.
